# All-in-One Video Player Demo

## Description

- This video player is currently accepting and playing the URLs from the below-mentioned sites:\
YouTube, Vimeo, Google Cloud, Amazon S3 Bucket, Random site video, etc.

- If the video URL has a null value / empty string / does not have a valid video link, then the video player screen will pop back to the previous screen and show the error message with the respective reason. For example, If Amazon S3 has a private bucket with restricted URL policies applied, in this case, the video player screen will pop back to the previous screen and show the error message in the snack bar.

- Note: This player has a configuration to play video after the initialization. You will not be able to see the thumbnail at the initial duration. If you want to see the video thumbnail, then pause the video and set the seek-bar slider at 00:00.

- Fun fact, you can pass any valid URL (for example, https://www.google.com/). Until & unless, If it is a valid URL address, it will open and play a video. Otherwise, it will pop back and show what went wrong.
